# Coursera regmods-032 Regression Models Project

## Context

A report for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a
data set of a collection of cars, they are interested in exploring the
relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome).
They are particularly interested in the following two questions:

* Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?
* Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions?
